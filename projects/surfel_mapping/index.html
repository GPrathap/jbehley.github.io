      <i>Abstract &mdash; </i>Accurate and reliable localization and mapping is a fundamental building block for most autonomous
      robots. For this purpose, we propose a novel, dense approach to laser-based mapping that operates on three-dimensional
      point clouds obtained from rotating laser sensors. We construct a surfel-based map and estimate the changes in the
      robot's pose by exploiting the projective data association between the current scan and a rendered model view from
      that surfel map. For detection and verification of a loop closure, we leverage the map representation to compose a
      virtual view of the map before a potential loop closure, which enables a more robust detection even with low overlap
      between the scan and the already mapped areas. Our approach is efficient and enables real-time capable registration.
      At the same time, it is able to detect loop closures and to perform map updates in an online fashion. Our experiments
      show that we are able to estimate globally consistent maps in large scale environments solely based on point cloud
      data.
